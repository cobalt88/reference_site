            An HTML document is broken up into several segments, These will vary from page to page but the bare minimum is a page <q>head</q> and a page <q>body</q>.<br>
            Above the page head you have to declare that this is infact an HTML page using the tag <q>!DOCTYPE html</q>.

            Oter common features you will see on most web pages include a language declaration <q>html lang="en"</q> for english,<br>
            this is helpful for web browsers as it tells the browser that the default language for the site is whatever you set it to. in this case English.<br>
            A character set attribute <q>meta charset="UTF-8"</q> is the most common and widely used, this will define what characters can be used in the webpage.<br>
            UTF-8, also known as the unicode standard, is so widely used because it covers nearly all characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world. <br>
            For more detailed onformation about character sets check out <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/default.asp">this page</a> from W3 Schools.

        <br>
        <p>
            Notice a few imprtant details about the image above.<br>
            Unlike before there is now a <q>/html</q> tag at the bottom of the page. <br>
            This is because we declared that the page uses HTML with the <q>html</q> tag. <br>
            Inside that tag is where we place the language declaration.<br>
            At the end of most lines of text there are <q>br</q> tags. Thease are Break Tags.<br>
            Without those tags all the text inside of that paragraph would be displayed on one line on your web page. <br>
            The <q>br</q> tags allow you to start a new line inside a paragraph. <br>
            Finally there is also the <q>p</q> or paragraph tag. 
            <br>
            Another element added that wasnt mentioned previously is the <q>h1</q> or header tag.<br>
            Header tags are useful elements for organizing data or parts of a web page.<br>
            They typically range from 1-6. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Each header tag will by default format the text according to its tag. h1 is used for the biggest and most important items,<br>
            while h6 is for the least important titles. <br> 
            <br>
            Here is an example of what each looks like.<br>
            <br>
            <img src="headers.png"><br>
                <cite>Header Tags</cite>
                <br>
            <h1>Header 1</h1>
            <h2>Header 2</h2>
            <h3>Header 3</h3>
            <h4>Header 4</h4>
            <h5>Header 5</h5>
            <h6>Header 6</h6>

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            And thats pretty much it for the bare bones version of an HTML web page. <br>
            From here there a lot of options to expand from with different tags, elements, attributes, CSS formatting, and JavaScript. <br>
            But to get even the most complex of web pages operational they need the most basic elements and attributes listed above. <br>
