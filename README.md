# reference_site
My personal reference site for all things HTML CSS and JavaScript

This entire project is continuously in progress and always being improved. Many of the pages are not styled and are simply raw HTML documents. 
That is on purpose. The main function of this site is to provide a visual reference of how different elements work, both on their own, and in conjunction with other elements, in as simple a format as is possible. 

You are free to copy any code you find herein, i do ask you reference this site if your taking large chunks of unaltered code,
otherwise do with it as you wish.

If you have any suggestions, questions, or would like to contribute to the project feel free to reach out via email to: vincentteune@gmail.com

Have fun
