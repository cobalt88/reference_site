# reference_site
https://cobalt88.github.io/reference_site/

My personal reference site for all things HTML CSS and JavaScript, Built as I am learning these languages from ground zero. 

This entire project is continuously in progress and always being improved. Many of the pages are not styled and are simply raw HTML documents. 
That is on purpose. The main function of this site is to provide a visual reference of how different elements work, both on their own, and in conjunction with the other languages, in as simple a format as is possible. 

My end goal with this project is a repository of knowlege for Web Developers of all stages to be able to reference whenever they need to see how a specific element, attribute, variable, selecter ect functions and interacts with everyting else its connected to. 

You are free to copy any code you find herein, I do ask you cite this project if your taking large chunks of unaltered code, and if you launch your own project based on what is built here id love to see it, 

otherwise do with it as you wish.

If you have any suggestions, questions, or would like to contribute to the project feel free to reach out via email to: vincentteune@gmail.com
I will set up a deticated slack or discord channel in the future if enough people are willing to contribute to the project. 

Have fun!
