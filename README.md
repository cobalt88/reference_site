# Project Reference Site
https://cobalt88.github.io/reference_site/

## The Intended Goal

Project reference site for all things HTML CSS and JavaScript,

This entire project is continuously in progress and always being improved. Some of the pages are not styled and are simply raw HTML documents. 
That is on purpose. The main function of this site is to provide a visual reference of how different elements work, both on their own, and in conjunction with the other languages, in as simple a format as is possible. 

My end goal with this project is a repository of knowlege for Web Developers of all stages to be able to reference whenever they need to see how a specific element, attribute, variable, selecter ect functions and interacts with everyting else its connected to. 

You are free to copy any code you find herein, I do ask you cite this project if your taking large chunks of unaltered code, and if you launch your own project based on what is built here id love to see it, 

otherwise do with it as you wish.

If you have any suggestions, questions, or would like to contribute to the project feel free to reach out via email to: vincentteune@gmail.com
I will set up a deticated slack or discord channel in the future if enough people are willing to contribute to the project. 

Have fun!

# Project Roadmap

This section is where we will post what we still need to make from scratch. If you see it listed here and it is not already assigned to a contributor that means its up for grabs in the event you woulf like to contribute to this project. 

## Pages To Be Built

### CSS Attribute Example Table - assigned

the css attribute table should be similar to the way we built the html tag table, 
include an example of the attribute syntax, 
a description of what it is and how it works, 
include a live example of the attribute. 
Include links to documentation for more detailed information on each attribute. 

### What Is The DOM? - Unassigned

Explain DOM (Document Object Model)
talk about what it is, why it is important, what it does, 

### About The Contributors - Unassigned

This is actualy a section that will be added to the main landing page rather than a page all on its own.
Include an article or card/box for each contributor of this prject, 
include a brief Bio for each contributor
include a list of the pages they helped create, 
include links to their personal prtfolios/websites

### GIT - Unassigned

git, GitHub, GitBash,
go over the differences between widows vs mac

### Landing/Main Page - Unassigned

To be dine dead last. this page is gojng to be broken up into segments and divied out to contributors ti develop as we find out what other sections we want to add. 

## JavaScript - this ones got a lot of chunks
------

### In Line JavaScript (in the HTML) - Unassigned

This section should be aimed more at a "why you shouldnt do this" kind of thing. Theres really no need for it with all the other options out there. 

### External Vanilla JavaScript - Unassigned

Go over the overall syntax of: 
* functions
* variables - var, const, let
* loops
* arrays
* conditionals
* anything else you might like to add a core fundamental part of vanilla javascript

provide lots of examples.

### node.js - Unassigned

Touch on hte following topics, but keep it simple, we can build separate pages for more detailed information on these:
* what is node.js
* why do we have it
* how to install
* how to use
* NPM
* build good transition into express

### Express.js - unassigned

#### closing notes:
------

please keep in mind the purpose of this site is to privide vanilla examples of how the core code of website development works. So do your best to not dynamically generate everything with JS and try to keep the styling contained to a hard coded CSS file on the core fundamental pages that are clean, easy to follow, do not include CSS frameworks. Once the core of it is all complete we can begin building out the more advnaced pages that go into modern web development, however that is not the primary goal of this project.
