                    <br/>
                    <p>Note: by default a hyperlink will open in the tab you are currently in unless you add target="blank" after href="". adding a blank target will cause the hyperlink to open in a new tab.</p>
                    <p>For general security reasons it is best to add rel="noopener noreferrer" if your going to have a blank target. The sytax for a hyperlink that openes in a new tab or window (in this example I am using www.google.com as the page the hyperlink will open) is as follows: </p>
                    <p>
                        &lt;a href="www.google.com" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;

                    the span tag is used to define an in-line section so that it can be targeted by CSS or JavaScript. Its similar to div and section accept that is not a block-level element, it is specifically for in-line applications.
                </td>
                <td>
                    the span element can be used for in-line styling to change <span style="color:red;font-size:larger">fonts</span> or pretty much anything that css can target. 
                    It is also useful for asigning small pieced of code <span id="span1">id tags</span> without changing any local formatting. 
                    If you look at the page source for this paragraph you will see the words "id tags" are assigned an id of span1, but no changes have been made to its formatting. 
                    this is so you could target #span1 with css or JS. you could aslo assign the span tag a class just like any other block level element. Wich is convenient for when ou dont want to make a new section or div.

                    WBR stands for word break opportunity, basically its a possible line break, wich can be useful for formatting, especially really lonng words that are too long to be displayed in one line. as the browser window shrinks the browser will make the content fit the available space, and this can often times make for some very weird formatting issues (unless you properly deploy the use of media querries) but even with media querries this can still be applied if you want a word to break up in a very specific way when the broser is si shrunk down.

                    Note: this is a non closing tag, meaning the sintax is &lt;wbr&gt;, nothing else, no closing tag, no slash like you normally have in a self closing tag like br, just wbr.

                    Shrink the browser window to see the difference. the top line has &lt;wbr&gt; tags between every word, and the second line does not.
