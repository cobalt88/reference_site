        HTML offers some very basic formatting options,<br> 
        Normally these options are used when you want a specific formatting to persist, reguardless of what the external CSS sheet may say.
    </center>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <pre>
        Some of these options include making the text preformatted or <q>preserved.</q>
        this segment is using the <q>pre</q> tag instead of paragraph, <q>p</q> or line break <q>br</q>
        What this does is preserve the formatting of the text, as it is written, in the HTML document. 
        so that you can create multiple lines of text without having to use the <q>br</q> or <q>p</q> tags.
        all spacing  ...      
                        ... 
                           ...  and indenting
                              ... 
                                 ... or any other in-document formatting
                                    ...
                                       ... is preserved as it is layed out in your HTML document. 

        Normally things like line indenting, line breaks, spacing between lines, any oth those sorts of things,
        are ignored unless a specific tag or CSS format is declared. the <q>pre</q> tag works differently. 

        this has its advantages at times.

        <b>Bold</b> 
        <i>Italicized</i> 
        <em>Emphasized</em> 
        <mark>Marked or highlighted</mark>
        <small>Small</small> 
        <del>Deleted</del> aka stricken,
        Text can be <ins>Inserted</ins> into an existing line
        or made into either <sub>subscript</sub> or <sup>superscript</sup>
        <q>Text can be quotated</q> with simple quotation marks
    </pre>

    <p>
        here is an example of a blockquote.
    </p>

        <blockquote>
            text can be blockquoted, <br>
            wich turns it into a text block <br>
            that is offset from the surrounding text. <br> 
            this can be especially useful for citing <br>
            large chunks of text from another site. <br>
        </blockquote>

    <p>
         something else that can be used is the "cite" tag that can be put into another tag<br>
         such as "blockquote" to add a link to where the quote was taken from. <br>
         the difference between this and an href is it is not visible in the main webpage, <br>
         but it can be seen inside the HTML document. It always required to cite any work,<br>
         be it code or text copied directly from another page. To fail to do so is Plagarism.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        speaking of citing, you can also use the "cite" tag on its own to show the name <br>
        of a pice of creative work, typically it will italicise the text wrapped in this tag. <br>
        <cite> 
            an example of what the "cite" tag does<br>
        </cite>
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        another text formatting feature is to make the text <strong>Strong</strong>. Strong is different from bold in that it is intended to be used for text that is more important than what is around it. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of formatting there is also styling.<br>
        Some styling options include font color, background, font type, font size, <br>
        these are actually css formatting options, they're just inserted directly into the HTML tags usint the <q>style</q> attribute instead of being assigned ID's that are targeted by an external CSS sheet.
        <p style="color:red">Red Text</p>
        <p style="font-family: sans-serif;">Sans Serif Font Family</p>
        <p style="font-size:xx-large">XL font size</p>
        <p style="font-size:xx-Small">Extra small font size</p>
        <p style="text-align:center">centered paragraph</p>
        <p style="text-align:right">Paragraph aligned to the right</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Text aligned to the left, this is the default alignment of text inside an HTML document however,<br>
        If you should say have an entire section of text that is formatted a specific way, maybe centered, and you want just one line or word<br>
        to break that formatting pattern this tag can be used to override any CSS formatting that you may have on an external Style Sheet.
